# AI Student Bot

This repository contains a minimal deployable example for an AI Student Bot using:
- FastAPI web service (web/)
- Background worker (worker/)
- Chroma vector DB (docker-compose dev)
- Dockerfiles, docker-compose, and Render blueprint (render.yaml)
- GitHub Actions workflow to trigger Render deploys on push to main (requires Render API secrets)

See infra/README_DEPLOY.md for exact GitHub + Render deploy instructions.
